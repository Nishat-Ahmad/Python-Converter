# Converter and Calculator

#### Description:

**angle.py** contains 6 functions that contain the logic of conversion between degree, radian and gradian. The 6 seperate functions achive this goal and they are very well documented. The fuctions take one value and return a value in float.

**currency.py** contains a total of 1 function that is semi-well documented and is used to convert from one currency type to another. It takes two values both of which are strings and returns one value that is also a string.

**geometry.py** contains a total of 2 classes and 15 functions divided 8-7 between the two classes. One of the class is used to find surface area and volume of 3D objects while the other class is used to find the area and the perimeter of 2D objects. The *three_dimensional class* supports upto 8 seperate objects and the *two_dimensional class* supports upto 7 seperate objects.

**temprature.py** contains a total of 6 funtions and have all the logic related to conversion between celsius, farenheit and kelvin. The functions are well documented and take one argument only that is the value that needs to be converted.

**weight.py** contains a total of 1 class and 2 functions. These are used to convert from one of the 5 supported weight type to gram and than the gram value is used to convert it back to another one of the 5 supported types. The supported types include ounce, pound, kilogram, gram and tonne. Both the functions are used in harmony and one in most cases cannot work without the other one.

**project.py** is the main file and contains all the called functions and the main function that are used to make the CLI alittle user friendly and to tell the user what to do next. There are a total of 6 functions in it and I could have done a better job but time constrain made me make certain decisions. These ones are not that well documented either as this file was written at the end.

**test_project** contains all the tests for the functions in project.py and the functions in other files were tested manually for the most part.

**requirements.txt** include libraries that are required to run this script properly.
